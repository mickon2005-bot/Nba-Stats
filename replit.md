## Design System

The application uses a modern, premium NBA-themed design system inspired by ESPN and NBA.com:

### Color Palette
- **Deep Court Blue** (#1a365d): Primary brand color for navigation and key actions
- **Electric Orange** (#ff6b35): Accent for live indicators, CTAs, and highlights
- **Vibrant Purple** (#6b46c1): Secondary accent for rankings and special features
- **Neon Cyan** (#00d9ff): Tertiary accent for interactive elements
- **Success Green** (#22c55e): Positive indicators (wins, made shots)
- **Destructive Red** (#ef4444): Negative indicators (losses, missed shots)

### Visual Style
- **Glassmorphism**: Cards with subtle transparency and backdrop blur effects
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Multi-color gradients for hero sections and featured content
- **Bold Typography**: Large headings with tracking for impact
- **Card-Based Layouts**: Rounded corners, hover elevations, and modern spacing
- **Monospaced Numbers**: Clean numerical data display with consistent alignment

### Design Patterns
- **Hero Sections**: Gradient backgrounds with stats overlay and grid patterns
- **Game Cards**: Status-based styling (live with red pulse, upcoming with time, final with winner highlight)
- **Player/Team Cards**: Rank badges for top performers, conference badges, detailed stats grids
- **Category Tabs**: Active state with gradient background, inactive with subtle elevation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
